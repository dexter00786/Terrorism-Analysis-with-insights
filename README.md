# Terrorism-Analysis-with-insights
This is a project of Data analytics which shows the trend of attacks that have taken place in a particular area.
 
The client gave us an excel file of 1,90,000 attacks that were taking place between 1970 to 2018 and his first expectation was that we should represent all the data on a map tool which shows the data of all over the world and another map tool which shows the data of India only. 

His second expectation was that to represent all the data using chart tool,
One chart tool for all over the world and other for India only. 

So to meet client expectations we have created a Scatter Geo Map  which represents data for all over the world and we can filter our data with 8 inputs(month, date, year, region, country, state, city and attack type).and it shows all the information about those resultant incidents that took place and shows information like attack type, region, country, latitude, longitude, state, city, year and number of people killed.
Another map which we have created is for India with all the same input dropdowns and shows the same information but only for India.

To meet the second expectation of the client we created two chart tools to represent data through charts one for the world and other for India. The client can filter data with 7 types of information in a dropdown menu (country attacked, region, target, nationality, target type, type of attack, weapon type, target organisation, etc) and for convenience there is a search filter which groups data according to region.  

If we hover our cursor over a point in the graph or  in the chart then it shows all the information of that incident.
Clients can run the python script using the command line which will open it in a browser with an UI. 
Client has an option on the web page to close the web browser after completion of his work and it will result in stopping the running script in the background.
